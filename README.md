# Adaptive Radix Tree

This is an Adaptive Radix Tree implementation ported from the C implementation [libart](https://github.com/armon/libart)

## Links:

 - Adaptive Radix Tree paper: [link](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf)

## TODO:
 - [ ] Implement a String map using the transformation described in part IV.B of the paper
 - [ ] API parity with BTreeMap (or at least more of its method implemented)
 - [ ] Increase test coverage -- there are many clean tests in this ART [implementation](https://github.com/rafaelkallis/adaptive-radix-tree/blob/master/test/art.cpp)
 - [ ] Add benchmarks comparing against BTreeMap
